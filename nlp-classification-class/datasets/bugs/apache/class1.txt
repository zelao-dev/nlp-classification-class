BUT, IT SET APACHE TO SPIN OUT OF CONTROL.IM A COMPLETE OUTSIDER OF THE APACHEMOD_SSL CODE. BUT THIS IS WHAT I FOUND. AS MENTIONED, APACHE DID SHUTDOWN THE FILTERS SSL CONNECTION. HOWEVER, IT CONTINUED TO READ IN GETLINEBLOCKING MODE THE REST OF THE REQUEST. HERE COMES THE PROBLEM. SSL_IO_INPUT_GETLINE() CALLS SSL_IO_INPUT_READ() TO READ TO A LF OR THE MAX. OF THE BUFFER CAN HANDLE, WHICHEVER COMES FIRST. BUT, SSL_IO_INPUT_READ() REALIZES THE FILTERS SSL CONNECTION HAS BEEN SHUTDOWN, IT RETURNS WITH THE LAST KNOWN STATUS OF THE BIO WHICH WAS CREATED TO READ FROM THIS SSL CONNECTION. IT ALSO SET THE RETURNED LENGTH TO 0. UNFORTUNATELY, THE CALLER GET APR_SUCCESS RETURN CODE AND BECAUSE THE RETURNED LENGTH IS 0, THE REMAINING BUFFER LENGTH DOES NOT GET CHANGED AT ALL. BECAUSE THE RETURN CODE IS ALWAYS APR_SUCCESS AND BECAUSE THE RETURNED LENGTH IS ALWAYS 0 AND THE BUFFER IS NOT FULL, SSL_IO_INPUT_GETLINE() KEEPS CALLING SSL_IO_INPUT_READ(). IT GOES ON FOREVER!","SUMMARY":"NON-TERMINATING IO","CLASS":1}
