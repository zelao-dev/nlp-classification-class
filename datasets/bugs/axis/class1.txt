CONSTRUCTING A MESSAGEELEMENT:TIF I WANT TO CREATE A PROPERTY, I MUST CONSTRUCT A MESSAGEELEMENT.   THERE ARE 9 CONSTRUCTORS IN THE MESSAGEELEMENT CLASS.  THE JAVADOC DOES NOT DESCRIBE ANY OF THE THEM.  IT MATTERS WHICH ONE IS CHOSEN. AFTER A LOT OF EXPERIMENTATION,  I ENDED UP USING THE MESSAGEELEMENT(ORG.W3C.ELEMENT) CONSTRUCTOR.   UNDER THE COVERS, THE MESSAGEELEMENT CLASS HAS SEVERAL MEMBER VARIABLES FOR HOLDING VALUE INFORMATION.  THE CONSTRUCTOR YOU USE DETERMINES WHICH MEMBER VARIABLE GETS USED (E.G. TEXT VS ELEMENT VS CHILDREN), AND ALSO DETERMINES HOW YOU TRY TO GET THE VALUE LATER.   THERE ARE ALSO MANY POSSIBILITIES FOR USING THE NO-ARGUMENT CONSTRUCTOR AND THE CALLING ONE OF THE MULTITUDE OF SET METHODS. THE SETOBJECTVALUE METHOD IS TEMPTING, BUT THE VALUE DOESNT MAKE IT ACROSS THE NETWORK CONNECTION.2. RETRIEVING THE VALUE:TTHERE IS NO USABLE GET METHOD ON A MESSAGEELEMENT.   EVEN IF YOU KNEW HOW IT WAS CREATED AND WHERE THE DATA WAS STORED IN THE MESSAGEELEMENT (E.G. TEXTREP, ELEMENTREP), THERE IS NO CORRESPONDING GET METHOD.  THERE IS A METHOD CALLED  GETASDOM, BUT THIS METHOD CALLS GETASSTRING AND THEN PARSES THE RESULT.  THE PROTECTED METHOD GETASSTRING() METHOD REQUIRES A MESSAGECONTEXT WHICH IS USED TO OBTAIN A SERIALIZATIONCONTEXT.  SINCE I CREATED THE MESSAGEELEMENT MYSELF, THERE IS NO MESSAGECONTEXT.  IF YOU CALL TOSTRING(), IT JUST CALLS GETASSTRING() .WORKAROUNDS:I ENDED UP CREATING A CLASS CALLED MESSAGEELEMENTHELPER WHICH HAS METHODS TO CREATE A MESSAGEELEMENT, TO CLONE A MESSAGEELEMENT AND TO FETCH ITS CONTENT.  IT IMPLEMENTS SERIALIZATIONCONTEXT SO I CAN USE THE OUTPUT() METHOD AND FAKE OUT THE SERIALIZATION CONTEXT.   NOTE THAT I HAD TO INSPECT THE SOURCE CODE FOR MESSAGEELEMENT IN ORDER TO DERIVE THIS SOLUTION.HERE IT IS:CONCLUSIONS:I HOPE I DESCRIBED THE PROBLEM WELL ENOUGH WITHOUT GOING IN TO TOO MUCH DETAIL.  FOLKS USING ANY IN THEIR MESSAGES ARE GOING TO HAVE TO USE MESSAGEELEMENT AND ITS PAINFUL.  I HAVE A COUPLE OF SUGGESTIONS GOING FORWARD.T1. CHANGE THE WSDL2JAVA PROGRAM TO GENERATE SOMETHING MORE USEABLE THAN MESSAGEELEMENT ARRAYS.T2. DOCUMENT MESSAGEELEMENT MORE PRECISELY, SPECIFICALLY FOR THIS USE CASET3. WRAP MESSAGEELEMENT IN A MORE USABLE FORM AND CHANGE WSDL2JAVA CORRESPONDINGLY. IT WOULD BE NICE TO HAVE SETELEMENT(W3C.DOM.ELEMENT) AND W3C.DOM.ELEMENT GETELEMENT() .

HONESTLY I DONT LIKE THE SCHEMA AT ALL, BUT IT IS PERFECTLY VALID. I THINK IT IS HARD TO PERFECTLY MATCH THE SEQUENCE CONCEPT TO A PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE, WHAT JAVA REALLY IMPLEMENTS IS MORE AN ALL KIND OF GROUPING (OF ITS FIELDS), SINCE THERE IS NO ORDERING BUT A INDEXING OF FIELDS BY NAME. I GUESS A SIMPLE WAY WOULD BE TO GENERATE DIFFERENT FIELD NAMES LIKE ANY1 ANY2 IN THE JAVA CLASS, BUT THIS IS DIFFICULT IN THE PARTICULAR CASE OF THE ANY BECAUSE OF THE ANYCONTENTTYPE INTERFACE (MAYBE ITS SOMETHING THAT NEEDS TO BE RETHOUGHT?) IN AXIS THAT MANDATES A GET_ANY() METHOD. MAYBE HAVE GET_ANY() RETURN THE CATENATION OF A GET_ANY1() AND A GET_ANY2() ?BUILD DATE: -----------I BUILD SOURCE FROM A CVS CHECK OUT MADE ON 12102003, AROUND 2:00 AMADDITIONAL NOTES-----------------THIS IS THE SAME BUG (OR VERY RELATED) AS 25195. I SENT THIS MESSAGE A WHILE AGO TO THE DEV LIST IN ORDER TO CHECK IT WAS A BUG, BUT I RECEIVED NO ANSWER. IN ADDITION, I DO NOT KNOW (SHAME ON ME) HOW TO ADD COMMENTS TO THE EXISTING BUG. BUG 25195 APPEARS AS A VARIATION WHERE THE CONTENT OF THE GROUPS (INSIDE THE <SEQUENCE> ELEMENTS) IS FLATTENED AS THE CONTENT OF THE GENERATED TYPE. LET ME ALSO POINT OUT THAT THE CONTENT MODEL OF THE SCHEMA TYPE SUBMITTED IN THE REPORT TO BUG 25195 IS AMBIGUOUS AND THEREFORE NOT VALID WITH RESPECT TO SCHEMA VALIDATION CONSTRAINTS. STILL, THERE WILL BE OTHER CASES OF THIS GENERATION OF MULTIPLE JAVA FIELDS OF THE SAME NAME BE THE ORIGINAL XML FIELS DIRECT OR INDIRECT CHILDREN OF THE SCHEMA TYPE.","SUMMARY":"SEVERAL XSD:ANY OR ELEMENTS WITH SAME NAMES --> SEVERAL IDENTICAL JAVA FIELDS","CLASS":1}

HOWEVER, COLLISION PROTECTION SHOULD NEVER BE PERFORMED FOR TYPES THAT ARE IN NAMESPACES THAT THE USER HAS INDICATED SHOULD BE EXCLUDED. HERES A USE CASE THAT DEMONSTRATES WHY:WSDL W TYPES TARGET NAMESPACE NSRED IMPORTS THREE OTHER WSDLS - NSORANGE, NSYELLOW, AND NSGREEN. NSORANGE AND NSYELLOW ALSO IMPORT NSGREEN. NSGREEN DEFINES AN ELEMENT NAMED DESTROY THAT HAS AN ANONYMOUS COMPLEX TYPE. I FIRST RUN WSDL2JAVA ON THE IMPORTED WSDLS AND JAR UP THE GENERATED TYPES INTO A REUSABLE LIB SPECTYPES.JAR. THE CLASS GENERATED FOR NSGREENS DESTROY TYPE IS NAMED _DESTROYTYPE. I THEN RUN WSDL2JAVA ON NSRED, SPECIFYING THAT NSORANGE, NSYELLOW, AND NSGREEN SHOULD BE EXCLUDED, AND INCLUDING SPECTYPES.JAR IN THE CLASSPATH. WSDL2JAVA ENCOUNTERS NSGREENS DESTROY ANON TYPE MULTIPLE TIMES IN ITS TRAVERSAL OF NSRED AND ITS IMPORTED WSDLS. EACH TIME IT ENCOUNTERS IT, ALTHOUGH IT DOESNT ACTUALLY GENERATE ANY CLASSES BECAUSE OF THE NAMESPACE EXCLUSION, IT KEEPS BUMPING UP THE CLASSNAME THAT IS STORED IN THE SYMBOLTABLE FOR THE ANON DESTROY TYPE.

UNFORTUNATELY, NO SUCH CLASS EXISTS; THE PREGENERATED CLASS THAT IS IN SPECTYPES.JAR IS NAMED _DESTROYTYPE, NOT _DESTROYTYPE5. SO WHEN I TRY TO COMPILE THE NSRED GENERATED CLASSES, I GET COMPILE ERRORS FOR THE IMPLS AND STUBS. IF COLLISION PROTECTION IS NEVER PERFORMED FOR TYPES IN EXCLUDED NAMESPACES, THIS ISSUE GOES AWAY.
