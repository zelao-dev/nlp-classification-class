BUT, IT SET APACHE TO SPIN OUT OF CONTROL.IM A COMPLETE OUTSIDER OF THE APACHEMOD_SSL CODE. BUT THIS IS WHAT I FOUND. AS MENTIONED, APACHE DID SHUTDOWN THE FILTERS SSL CONNECTION. HOWEVER, IT CONTINUED TO READ IN GETLINEBLOCKING MODE THE REST OF THE REQUEST. HERE COMES THE PROBLEM. SSL_IO_INPUT_GETLINE() CALLS SSL_IO_INPUT_READ() TO READ TO A LF OR THE MAX. OF THE BUFFER CAN HANDLE, WHICHEVER COMES FIRST. BUT, SSL_IO_INPUT_READ() REALIZES THE FILTERS SSL CONNECTION HAS BEEN SHUTDOWN, IT RETURNS WITH THE LAST KNOWN STATUS OF THE BIO WHICH WAS CREATED TO READ FROM THIS SSL CONNECTION. IT ALSO SET THE RETURNED LENGTH TO 0. UNFORTUNATELY, THE CALLER GET APR_SUCCESS RETURN CODE AND BECAUSE THE RETURNED LENGTH IS 0, THE REMAINING BUFFER LENGTH DOES NOT GET CHANGED AT ALL. BECAUSE THE RETURN CODE IS ALWAYS APR_SUCCESS AND BECAUSE THE RETURNED LENGTH IS ALWAYS 0 AND THE BUFFER IS NOT FULL, SSL_IO_INPUT_GETLINE() KEEPS CALLING SSL_IO_INPUT_READ(). IT GOES ON FOREVER!","SUMMARY":"NON-TERMINATING IO","CLASS":1}

CONSTRUCTING A MESSAGEELEMENT:TIF I WANT TO CREATE A PROPERTY, I MUST CONSTRUCT A MESSAGEELEMENT.   THERE ARE 9 CONSTRUCTORS IN THE MESSAGEELEMENT CLASS.  THE JAVADOC DOES NOT DESCRIBE ANY OF THE THEM.  IT MATTERS WHICH ONE IS CHOSEN. AFTER A LOT OF EXPERIMENTATION,  I ENDED UP USING THE MESSAGEELEMENT(ORG.W3C.ELEMENT) CONSTRUCTOR.   UNDER THE COVERS, THE MESSAGEELEMENT CLASS HAS SEVERAL MEMBER VARIABLES FOR HOLDING VALUE INFORMATION.  THE CONSTRUCTOR YOU USE DETERMINES WHICH MEMBER VARIABLE GETS USED (E.G. TEXT VS ELEMENT VS CHILDREN), AND ALSO DETERMINES HOW YOU TRY TO GET THE VALUE LATER.   THERE ARE ALSO MANY POSSIBILITIES FOR USING THE NO-ARGUMENT CONSTRUCTOR AND THE CALLING ONE OF THE MULTITUDE OF SET METHODS. THE SETOBJECTVALUE METHOD IS TEMPTING, BUT THE VALUE DOESNT MAKE IT ACROSS THE NETWORK CONNECTION.2. RETRIEVING THE VALUE:TTHERE IS NO USABLE GET METHOD ON A MESSAGEELEMENT.   EVEN IF YOU KNEW HOW IT WAS CREATED AND WHERE THE DATA WAS STORED IN THE MESSAGEELEMENT (E.G. TEXTREP, ELEMENTREP), THERE IS NO CORRESPONDING GET METHOD.  THERE IS A METHOD CALLED  GETASDOM, BUT THIS METHOD CALLS GETASSTRING AND THEN PARSES THE RESULT.  THE PROTECTED METHOD GETASSTRING() METHOD REQUIRES A MESSAGECONTEXT WHICH IS USED TO OBTAIN A SERIALIZATIONCONTEXT.  SINCE I CREATED THE MESSAGEELEMENT MYSELF, THERE IS NO MESSAGECONTEXT.  IF YOU CALL TOSTRING(), IT JUST CALLS GETASSTRING() .WORKAROUNDS:I ENDED UP CREATING A CLASS CALLED MESSAGEELEMENTHELPER WHICH HAS METHODS TO CREATE A MESSAGEELEMENT, TO CLONE A MESSAGEELEMENT AND TO FETCH ITS CONTENT.  IT IMPLEMENTS SERIALIZATIONCONTEXT SO I CAN USE THE OUTPUT() METHOD AND FAKE OUT THE SERIALIZATION CONTEXT.   NOTE THAT I HAD TO INSPECT THE SOURCE CODE FOR MESSAGEELEMENT IN ORDER TO DERIVE THIS SOLUTION.HERE IT IS:CONCLUSIONS:I HOPE I DESCRIBED THE PROBLEM WELL ENOUGH WITHOUT GOING IN TO TOO MUCH DETAIL.  FOLKS USING ANY IN THEIR MESSAGES ARE GOING TO HAVE TO USE MESSAGEELEMENT AND ITS PAINFUL.  I HAVE A COUPLE OF SUGGESTIONS GOING FORWARD.T1. CHANGE THE WSDL2JAVA PROGRAM TO GENERATE SOMETHING MORE USEABLE THAN MESSAGEELEMENT ARRAYS.T2. DOCUMENT MESSAGEELEMENT MORE PRECISELY, SPECIFICALLY FOR THIS USE CASET3. WRAP MESSAGEELEMENT IN A MORE USABLE FORM AND CHANGE WSDL2JAVA CORRESPONDINGLY. IT WOULD BE NICE TO HAVE SETELEMENT(W3C.DOM.ELEMENT) AND W3C.DOM.ELEMENT GETELEMENT() .

HOWEVER, COLLISION PROTECTION SHOULD NEVER BE PERFORMED FOR TYPES THAT ARE IN NAMESPACES THAT THE USER HAS INDICATED SHOULD BE EXCLUDED. HERES A USE CASE THAT DEMONSTRATES WHY:WSDL W TYPES TARGET NAMESPACE NSRED IMPORTS THREE OTHER WSDLS - NSORANGE, NSYELLOW, AND NSGREEN. NSORANGE AND NSYELLOW ALSO IMPORT NSGREEN. NSGREEN DEFINES AN ELEMENT NAMED DESTROY THAT HAS AN ANONYMOUS COMPLEX TYPE. I FIRST RUN WSDL2JAVA ON THE IMPORTED WSDLS AND JAR UP THE GENERATED TYPES INTO A REUSABLE LIB SPECTYPES.JAR. THE CLASS GENERATED FOR NSGREENS DESTROY TYPE IS NAMED _DESTROYTYPE. I THEN RUN WSDL2JAVA ON NSRED, SPECIFYING THAT NSORANGE, NSYELLOW, AND NSGREEN SHOULD BE EXCLUDED, AND INCLUDING SPECTYPES.JAR IN THE CLASSPATH. WSDL2JAVA ENCOUNTERS NSGREENS DESTROY ANON TYPE MULTIPLE TIMES IN ITS TRAVERSAL OF NSRED AND ITS IMPORTED WSDLS. EACH TIME IT ENCOUNTERS IT, ALTHOUGH IT DOESNT ACTUALLY GENERATE ANY CLASSES BECAUSE OF THE NAMESPACE EXCLUSION, IT KEEPS BUMPING UP THE CLASSNAME THAT IS STORED IN THE SYMBOLTABLE FOR THE ANON DESTROY TYPE.

UNFORTUNATELY, NO SUCH CLASS EXISTS; THE PREGENERATED CLASS THAT IS IN SPECTYPES.JAR IS NAMED _DESTROYTYPE, NOT _DESTROYTYPE5. SO WHEN I TRY TO COMPILE THE NSRED GENERATED CLASSES, I GET COMPILE ERRORS FOR THE IMPLS AND STUBS. IF COLLISION PROTECTION IS NEVER PERFORMED FOR TYPES IN EXCLUDED NAMESPACES, THIS ISSUE GOES AWAY.

DOING THE SAME WITH 2.6.25, BASICALLY THE SAME CONFIG FILE, BOOTS WITHOUT PROBLEMS.I TRIED TO FORWARD-PORT THE FUSION DRIVER FROM 2.6.25 TO 2.6.26-RC7 BY SIMPLY COPYING OVER THE DIRECTORY DRIVERSMESSAGEFUSION FROM 2.6.25 TO 2.6.26-RC7 BUT UNFORTUNATELY THIS DOESNT COMPILE, SO I AM STUCK NOT BEING ABLE TO USE 2.6.26 ON THIS MACHINE (ACTUALLY I HAVE NOT TRIED VERSIONS OF 2.6.26 EARLIER THAN RC7... I DONT HAVE MUCH TIME NOW).I CONNECTED A SERIAL CABLE IN ORDER TO OBTAIN THE BOOT ERROR MESSAGE. I OBTAINED TWO OF THOSE ON DIFFERENT BOOTS.
