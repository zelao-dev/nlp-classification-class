I HAVE DONE VARIOUS DEBUGGING SUCH AS SNOOPS, TRUSSES AND DEBUG APACHE LOGGING.WHAT SEEMS TO HAPPEN IS THE FIRST (SUCCESSFUL) REQUEST WORKS AS EXPECTED, HOWEVER WHEN THE SECOND REQUEST IS SENT, THE SSL SESSION BETWEEN THE CLIENT AND PROXY IS SET UP OKAY, BUT THE SSL CONNECTION BETWEEN THE PROXY AND BACKEND SERVER HAS PROBLEMS.  BASICALLY IT (THE PROXY) SETS UP THE TCP SESSION OKAY, SENDS AN SSL CLIENT HELLO, BUT THEN ALMOST STRAIGHT AWAY SENDS A FIN.I THEN LOOKED AT THE APACHE ERROR LOG, WITH FULL DEBUGGING ENABLED TO SEE WHY THE PROXY WOULD SEND A CLIENT HELLO, AND THEN STRAIGHT AWAY SEND A FIN.  IT SEEMS THAT THERE IS AN ISSUE WITH AN SSL BIO BEING LOGGED.  IT SAYS THAT 07 BYTES ARE BEING READ FROM THE BIO WHENEVER THE CONNECTION IS FAILING.

{"ID_DEFECT":"7617","DESCRIPTION":"THIS IS A REPOST OF A BUG THAT I REPORTED TO DEV@HTTPD.APACHE.ORG LIST IN 2001. SINCE THAT FORUM IS USUALLY PRIMARILY CONCERNED WITH DEVELOPMENT OF APACHE 2, I AM OPEN THIS AS A BUGZILLA BUG. THE BUG NEVER MADE IT INTO THE FORMER APACHE BUGTRACKING SYSTEM, ALTHOUGH IT DID HAVE SOME SIMILARITIES TO SOME (VERY OLD) EXISTING BUG REPORTS FOR VARIOUS ARCHITECTURES.THERE IS AN APPARENT RACE CONDITION IN APACHE 1.3.X CGI HANDLING WHICH RESULTS IN OCCASIONAL UNNECESSARY 3-SECOND DELAYS RESULTING FROM A PAUSE BETWEEN WHEN A CGI CHILD PROCESS CLOSES IT OUTPUT PIPE AND WHEN THAT PROCESS SUBSEQUENTLY EXITS. UNDER NORMAL CIRCUMSTANCES, IT APPEARS THAT ONLY SOLARIS X86 IS MAJORLY AFFECTED.SPECIFICALLY, THE CODE IN MOD_CGI.C READS FROM ITS CHILD PROCESS UNTIL THE CHILD PROCESS BREAKS THE PIPE. THE CLEANUP CODE IN ALLOC.C THEN CALLS WAITPID() WITH WNOHANG TO CHECK TO SEE IF ITS CHILD PROCESS HAS DIED; IF ITS PID IS NOT WAITING, APACHE ASSUMES THAT THE PROCESS HAS HUNG. IT SENDS A SIGTERM, WAITS 3 SECONDS, THEN SENDS A SIGKILL. THE RELEVANT CODE IS IN FREE_PROC_CHAIN() IN ALLOC.C.THE FORMER ASSUMPTION (IF THE CHILD PID IS NOT WAITING TO BE REAPED, THE CHILD PROCESS MUST HAVE HUNG AND SHOULD BE KILLED) APPEARS TO BE ERRONEOUS ON AT LEAST SOME CONFIGURATIONS. SPECIFICALLY, IMAGINE THAT THE CGI CHILD PROCESS EXITS 10MS AFTER THE CLEANUP CODE IN ALLOC.C IS RUN. IN THIS CASE, THE APACHE PROCESS SLEEPS 3 SECONDS, WHEN REALLY IT DIDNT NEED TO.THIS PROBLEM IS ONLY CLIENT-VISIBLE WITH HTTP1.1 KEEP-ALIVE, APACHE RUNNING AS A SINGLE PROCESS, OR BAD LUCK WHERE THE CLIENT TALKS TO THE SAME CHILD MORE THAN ONCE. THE USER-VISIBLE SYMPTOM IS THEN A 3-SECOND DELAY FOLLOWING A CGI REQUEST, BEFORE THE NEXT REQUEST IS SERVICED.TO TRY TO REPRODUCE THE PROBLEM:    * BUILD APACHE OUT OF THE BOX WITH A STRAIGHT CONFIGURE    * ENABLE .CGI PROCESSING. HERE IS THE DIFF BETWEEN THE DEFAULT CONFIG      FILE AND THE ONE WITH .CGI PROCESSING ENABLED:          317C317          <     OPTIONS INDEXES FOLLOWSYMLINKS MULTIVIEWS          ---          >     OPTIONS INDEXES FOLLOWSYMLINKS MULTIVIEWS EXECCGI          784C784          <     #ADDHANDLER CGI-SCRIPT .CGI          ---          >     ADDHANDLER CGI-SCRIPT .CGI    * PUT A TEST CGI UNDER THE DEFAULT DOCUMENTROOT. HERE IS ONE THAT      EXPLICITLY TRIGGERS THE BUG:          #!USRLOCALBINPERL          # BREAK.CGI - TRIGGERS THE 3-SECOND DELAY ON ANY SYSTEM          PRINT CONTENT-TYPE: TEXTPLAIN;          PRINT HELLO, WORLD.;          CLOSE STDOUT;          SLEEP 1;      AND HERE IS ONE THAT SHOULD NOT TRIGGER THE BUG PURPOSELY, BUT STILL      EXHIBITS PROBLEMS ON OUR SOLARIS X86 SYSTEMS:          #!USRLOCALBINPERL          # TEST.CGI - ON SOLARIS X86, SOMETIMES EXHIBITS 3-SECOND DELAY          PRINT CONTENT-TYPE: TEXTPLAIN;          PRINT HELLO, WORLD.;    * CONNECT TO THE HTTP SERVER VIA TELNET, AND MAKE A KEEP-ALIVE REQUEST.      REPEAT THE REQUEST AFTER GETTING A RESPONSE. WITH BREAK.CGI, YOU SHOULD      SEE A 3-SECOND DELAY AFTER EVERY RESPONSE. WITH TEST.CGI ON AN AFFECTED      SYSTEM, THE 3-SECOND DELAY OCCURS REGULARLY BUT SPORADICALLY.ON SOLARIS X86 ON A DUAL-PROCESSOR BOX, WE SEE THIS BEHAVIOR PERHAPS 10-20% OF THE TIME FOR ANY PARTICULAR CHILD (USING THE TEST.CGI CASE ABOVE). ON MOST OTHER SYSTEMS WE TESTED, YOU HAVE TO EXPLICITLY TRY TO TRIGGER THE BUG (FOR EXAMPLE, USING THE BREAK.CGI ABOVE).WERE NOT SURE WHY SOLARIS X86 EXHIBITS THE DELAY EVEN WITHOUT A FORCED DELAY BETWEEN PIPE CLOSING AND PROCESS EXIT. PERHAPS SOLARIS IS DOING SOME CLEANUP THAT LINUX IS NOT, OR THERE IS SOME CHILD REAPING ISSUE WITH THE MULTIPLE PROCESSORS.HERE ARE THE CONFIGURATIONS WE TESTED. PATCHED APACHES (WITH MOD_PERL OR MOD_SSL CAPABILITIES) HAD THE SAME BEHAVIORS AS STRAIGHT OUT-OF-THE-BOX CONFIGURATIONS; HAVING DSOS ENABLED WAS LIKEWISE IRRELEVANT.    * SOLARIS X86, DUAL PROCESSOR INTEL BOXES, APACHE 1.3.9, 1.3.1[247], 1.3.24        * ON APACHE 1.3.14, MOD_PERL AND MOD_SSL AND NON-DSO VARIANTS        * ALL CONFIGURATIONS DISPLAY SPORADIC 3-SECOND CGI DELAYS          EVEN IN A SIMPLE HELLO, WORLD CGI.    * SOLARIS ON A SINGLE PROCESSOR SPARC BOX, APACHE 1.3.12, 1.3.24;      LINUX, SINGLE PROCESSOR INTEL BOXES, APACHE 1.3.12, 1.3.14;      FREEBSD, DUAL PROCESSOR INTEL BOX, APACHE 1.3.12;      OPENBSD, SINGLE PROCESS INTEL BOX, APACHE 1.3.12        * WITHOUT EXPLICITLY CLOSING STDOUT, THE BUG DOESNT APPEAR,          BUT IF YOU CLOSE STDOUT AND DO REALLY ANYTHING AT ALL          (INCLUDING JUST A TIMING LOOP), THE BUG APPEARSI WILL ATTACH MY TEST SCRIPT, A SIMPLE PERL SCRIPT THAT OPENS A SOCKET CONNECTION TO A WEBSERVER AND DOES REPEATED HTTP1.1 KEEP-ALIVE REQUESTS, TIMING EACH TRIAL, TO THIS BUG. IT VASTLY SIMPLIFIES THE LAST STEP IN THE REPRO CASE ABOVE.THIS BUG MAY BE THE SAME AS PR 6961 (REPEATED REQUESTS FOR A SIMPLE CGI INVOKE DELAY OF APACHE) AND IS RELATED LOOSELY TO PR 6226 (CLOSING STDOUT DOESNT END SESSION TO ALLOW BACKGROUND PROCESSING OF CODE). I ALSO ORIGINALLY SENT AN E-MAIL TO DEV@HTTPD.APACHE.ORG ABOUT THIS, WHICH CAME UP WITH A COUPLE FOLLOWUPS. THE URL TO THAT IN THE ARCHIVE IS HERE:    HTTP:GROUPS.YAHOO.COMGROUPNEW-HTTPDMESSAGE19853THERE WAS A VERY SHORT DISCUSSION (APPARENTLY THIS PROBLEM HAS A BIT OF A HISTORY!)

THIS INVOLVES A CHANGE IN AN INNER CLASS CALLED INSTREAM OF THE MMDS CLASS.THE CLOSE() METHOD OF THE INSTREAM CLASS IS CALLED BY THE DELETE() METHOD OF THE MMDS CLASS. HOWEVER, THE TROUBLE IS THE DELETE() METHOD ITERATES OVER A WEAKHASHMAP AND THE CLOSE() METHOD IN THE INSTREAM CLASS TRIES TO REMOVE ELEMENTS FROM THIS WEAKHASHMAP. TO AVOID THIS RACE CONDITION, I HAVE CREATED ANOTHER METHOD CLOSESTREAM() IN THE INSTREAM CLASS WHICH, CAN BE INVOKED BY THE DELETE() METHOD IN THE MMDS CLASS. DELETING ELEMENTS FROM THE WEAKHASHMAP ISNT AFFECTED IN ANYWAY AS THE HASHMAP IS CLEARED OF ALL ITS ELEMENTS BEFORE THE METHOD RETURNS.

MY CARD IS AN ADAPTEC APA-1460, WHICH WORKS UNDER THE EXTERNAL PCMCIASUBSYSTEM WITH V2.4.20, AND UNDER THE INTERNAL VERSION WITH V2.4.21.WHEN THE CARD IS PLUGGED IN, THERE IS A KERNEL OOPS WITH THE MESSAGEUNABLE TO HANDLE KERNEL NULL POINTER DEREFERENCE AT VIRTUAL ADDRESS 0.FROM THE STACK DUMP AND TEST PRINTK STATEMENTS, I DISCOVERED THAT THEOOPS OCCURS DURING THE CALL TO LIST_ADD_TAIL FROM ROUTINE SCSI_REGISTER.THE PROBLEM IS THAT THE LIST_HEADS NEXT AND PRV IN SHT->LEGACY_HOSTS BOTH CONTAIN NULL. I INTERPRET THIS TO MEAN THAT THE STRUCTURE AHA152X_DRIVER_TEMPLATE HAS NEVER BEEN INITIALIZED. WHEN I PLACE THE STATEMENT INIT_LIST_HEAD(&SHT->LEGACY_HOSTS) BEFORE THE CALL TO LIST_ADD_TAIL, THE DRIVER LOADS, BUT THE SYSTEM FREEZES WHEN I SCAN THAT SCSI BUS USING A CDRECORD -SCANBUS STATEMENT.

IN OUR CASE THE ERROR WAS AN EEXIST AND THIS IS BECAUSE OF 3 OTHER BUGS IN THE SAME MODULE.   1) THE COUNT OF SG DEVICES, SG_NR_DEV DOES NOT MATCH THE NUMBER OF AVAILABLE ENTRIES IN SG_DEV_ARR BECAUSE OF A CODING PROBLEM IN SG_REMOVE. UNDER SOME CONDITIONS, THE COUNT IS DECREMENTED WHEN THE ENTRY IS NOT CLEARED.       2) IF NO AVAILABLE ENTRY IS FOUND IN SG_DEV_ARR, THE VALUE USED FOR K WILL BE SG_DEV_MAX AND WILL CAUSE TO OVERFLOW THE SG_DEV_ARR TABLE. (AND WILL ALSO CAUSE THE EEXIST ON THE VERY NEXT PASS). OF COURSE THIS WILL ONLY HAPPEND IF SG_NR_DEV DOES NOT REFLECT THE TABLE.   3) THERE IS A POSSIBLE RACE CONDITION IN THE CODE WHICH GROWS THE SG_DEV_ARR TABLE BECAUSE THE LOCK IS RELEASED.

{"ID_DEFECT":"9468","DESCRIPTION":"(SHAMELESS REPOST FROM MY MAIL TO LKML. SEEMS TO HAVE GONE QUIET SO I THOUGHT I WOULDNT LET THIS BUGGER GET LOST.)I HAVE RECENTLY ASSEMBLED A CORE 2 DUO SYSTEM WITH 4GB RAM AND I BELIEVE THERE MIGHT BE A BUG IN THE R8169 DRIVER IN >4GB RAM CONFIGURATIONS.INITIALLY I CAN USE ONE OF TWO ACTIVE R8169 NICS ON THE MOTHERBOARD WITH THIS QUANTITY OF RAM WITH OTHER DEVICES, WITHOUT ISSUE. BUT AFTER SOME AMOUNT OF DATA (GENERALLY ABOUT 50MB), NO MORE NETWORK PACKETS ARE SENTRECEIVED.THE CHOKE AFFECTS OTHER DEVICES ON THE SYSTEM TOO, NOTABLY LIBATA, WHICH DOES NOT RECOVER GRACEFULLY. IN MY LOGS, I SEE A STREAM OF:DMA: OUT OF SW-IOMMU SPACE FOR 7222 BYTES AT DEVICE 0000:04:00.0DMA: OUT OF SW-IOMMU SPACE FOR 7222 BYTES AT DEVICE 0000:04:00.0THE DEVICE 0000:04:00.0 CORRESPONDS TO ONE OF THE R8169S.THE REASON I BELIEVE R8169 IS AT FAULT IS THAT I WAS DOING A REBUILD OF MY RAID5 ACROSS 3 SATA DRIVES VIA LIBATAS AHCI DRIVER, AND TRANSFERRING OVER THE NETWORK. WHEN THE CHOKE OCCURRED THE RAID SYNC STOPPED, LIBATA ERRORS WERE SEEN, AND I SIMPLY DID A IFCONFIG BR0 DOWN (WHICH CONTAINED THE R8169) AND THE MESSAGES WENT AWAY. BRINGING THE NIC UP AGAIN WOULD SEE SOME INITIAL FUNCTIONALITY THEN VERY RAPIDLY IT WOULD GO BACK TO THE SAME ERROR MESSAGES.THE INTEL CHIPSET I AM USING DOES NOT SUPPORT ANY KIND OF HARDWARE IOMMU, SO I AM FORCED TO USE SWIOTLB IN A 4GB RAM CONFIGURATION. IN AN ATTEMPT TO DELAY THE FAILURES, I USED THE SWIOTLB OPTION TO INCREASE THE SWIOTLBS PAGE ALLOCATION WITH SWIOTLB=65536 (WHICH SEEMS TO CORRESPOND TO A 256MB BOUNCE BUFFER).ASSUMING BOTH LIBATA AND R8169 USE THE SWIOTLB, AND BOTH SYSTEMS ARE IMPAIRED WHEN THESE MESSAGES APPEAR, REMOVING R8169 WOULD APPEAR TO BE KEY. INDEED, IF THERE IS NO SIGNIFICANT LIBATA ACTIVITY, THE PROBLEM STILL OCCURS ON THE NIC WITHIN APPROXIMATELY THE SAME AMOUNT OF TRANSFER.THIS OPTION DELAYS THE FAILURE FOR SOME TIME BUT IT WILL HAPPEN EVENTUALLY, WHICH MAKES ME SUSPICIOUS THAT MAYBE THE DRIVER IS SOMEHOW PINNING AN AREA OF THE BUFFER AND NOT RELEASING IT. (I HUNTED BUGZILLA FOR REPORTS SIMILAR TO THIS ONE, BUT COULDNT FIND ANYTHING.)HAVING TESTED THE R8169 DRIVER ON AN AMD SYSTEM I DID NOT EXPERIENCE THE SAME PROBLEMS WITH 4GB RAM, SO THIS COULD BE A BUG SPECIFIC TO SWIOTLB.

IN THIS MOMENT I REALIZED THAT I DIDNT CHANGE INTERNET CONFIGURATIONS, BUT I THOUGHT THAT IT CAN BE WRONG IN HARDWARE CONFIGURATIONS.

THEN, I COMPILED KERNEL 2.6.26.5 WITH EXACLY THE SAME .CONFIG FILE LIKE KERNEL FROM DEBIAN DISTRIBUTION (2.6.18-6-K7) AND INTERNET DIDNT WORK TOO. AFTER THAT, I COMPILED OLDER KERNEL (2.6.17) WITH THIS .CONFIG FILE AND INTERNET STARTED WORKING!

{"ID_DEFECT":"24860","DESCRIPTION":"     [6 DEC 2006 18:17]   RAFAL SOMLA          DESCRIPTION:DUE TO INCORRECT IMPLEMENTATION OF SLAVE_TRANSACTION_RETRIES VARIABLE HANDLING IT IS POSSIBLE THAT REPLICATION SLAVE WILL ENTER INFINITE LOOP REPEATING STATEMENT WHICH TRIGGERS TRANSIENT ERROR.REPLICATION SLAVE REPEATS EXECUTION OF A REPLICATION EVENT IF IT TRIGGERS AN ERROR CONSIDERED TO BE TRANSIENT (CURRENTLY DEFINED BY HAS_TEMPORARY_ERROR() FUNCTION IN SLAVE.CC). THE NUMBER OF RETRIES IS SUPPOSED TO BE LIMITED BY THE VALUE OF GLOBAL SLAVE_TRANSACTION_RETRIES VARIABLE.THIS IS IMPLEMENTED INSIDE THE MAIN EVENT EXECUTION LOOP INSIDE SLAVES SQL THREAD (FUNCTIONS HANDLE_SLAVE_SQL() AND EXEC_RELAY_LOG_EVENT() IN SLAVE.CC) WHICH, UPON DETECTION THAT AN ERROR RETURNED BY EV->EXEC_EVENT() IS TRANSIENT, REWINDS RELAY LOG TO THE POSITION OF THE EVENT (THIS IS COMPLICATED BY EVENT GROUPS AS EXPLAINED BELOW). AS A RESULT, NEXT ITERATION OF EVENT EXECUTION LOOP WILL READ THE SAME EVENT AND EXECUTE IT AGAIN.WHEN EVENT IS REPEATED, VARIABLE RLI->TRANS_RETRIES IS INCREASED AND CHECKED AGAINST THE VALUE OF SLAVE_TRANSACTION_RETRIES VARIABLE SO THAT REPETITIONS ARE STOPPED AFTER THIS MANY TRIES. RLI->TRANS_RETRIES IS RESET TO ZERO UPON SUCCESSFUL EXECUTION OF THE EVENT.A POSSIBLE PROBLEM IS CAUSED BY EXISTENCE OF EVENT GRUPS IN THE REPLICATION LOG. WHEN REPLICATING SINGLE SQL STATEMENT (IN ROW BASED REPLICATION), SEVERAL EVENTS CAN BE GENERATED WHICH FORM SINGLE EVENT GROUP IN THE LOG. FOR EXAMPLE, WHEN REPLICATING INSERT STATEMENT, FIRST TABLE_MAP EVENT IS GENERATED AND THEN ONE OR MORE WRITE_ROWS EVENTS. NOW, WHEN A TRANSIENT ERROR IS ENCOUNTERED DURING EVENT EXECUTION, RELAY LOG IS REWIND TO THE BEGINNING OF THE WHOLE EVENT GROUP CONTAINING THAT EVENT. THUS, THE WHOLE GROUP WILL BE REPEATED. NOW CONSIDER THE FOLLOWING EVENT GROUP:1. TABLE_MAP EVENT    EXECUTES OK2. WRITE_ROWS EVENT   TRIGGERS TRANSIENT ERROR, REPEAT FROM 1.THEN RLI->TRANS_RETRIES IS INCREASED WHEN EVENT 2 IS EXECUTED AND TRANSIENT ERROR IS DETECTED BUT IT IS RESET TO ZERO AFTER EXECUTING EVENT 1. AS A RESULT THIS EVENT GROUP WILL BE REPEATED AD INFINITUM UNLESS THE ERROR CONDITION DISSAPEARS.NOTE: THIS IS NOT VERY CRITICAL BECAUSE TRANSIENT ERRORS, BY DEFINITION, SHOULD DISSAPEAR AFTER SOME TIME.HOW TO REPEAT:NOT EASY BECAUSE IT IS DIFFICULT TO PROVOKE A TRANSIENT ERROR. I MANAGED TO GET THE FAULTY BEHAVIOUR BY MODIFYING EXEC_RELAY_LOG_EVENT() CODE SO THAT ALL EVENT EXECUTION ERRORS ARE CONSIDERED TRANSIENT:    IF (SLAVE_TRANS_RETRIES)    -     IF (EXEC_RES && HAS_TEMPORARY_ERROR(THD) )+     IF (EXEC_RES * && HAS_TEMPORARY_ERROR(THD) * )              CONST CHAR *ERRMSG;STILL IT WAS NOT EASY TO GET AN ERROR ONLY IN A SECOND EVENT OF AN EVENT GROUP. I MANAGED TO DO IT BY CREATING FOREIGN KEY CONSTRAINT ON A TABLE, WHICH IS SATISFIED ON MASTER, WHILE ON SLAVE I MODIFY THE EXTERNAL TABLE SO THAT THE CONSTRAINT FAILS. THIS WAY THE TABLE_MAP EVENT EXECUTES CORRECTLY BUT THERE IS AN ERROR DURING WRITE_ROWS EVENT. THE TEST CASE LOOKS AS FOLLOWS:-- SOURCE INCLUDEMASTER-SLAVE.INC-- CONNECTION MASTERCREATE TABLE T1 (A INT PRIMARY KEY) ENGINE=INNODB;CREATE TABLE T2 (A INT, B INT, FOREIGN KEY (B) REFERENCES T1(A)) ENGINE=INNODB;SET AUTOCOMMIT=1;INSERT INTO T1 VALUES (1);-- SYNC_SLAVE_WITH_MASTERSTOP SLAVE SQL_THREAD;DELETE FROM T1 WHERE A=1;-- CONNECTION MASTERINSERT INTO T2 VALUES (2,1);-- SAVE_MASTER_POS--CONNECTION SLAVESTART SLAVE SQL_THREAD;-- SYNC_WITH_MASTERSUGGESTED FIX:RESET RLI->TRANS_RETRIES ONLY WHEN A NEW EVENT GROUP STARTS.
